Hello, my name is Joel.

Three words to describe me are caffeinated, conscientious, and collected.

I enjoy alliteration, cooking, and following technology trends. Recently I have been watching too many "aquascaping" videos on YouTube (why???) and buying too many houseplants. I have two dogs named Hugo and Lola.

This is more content demonstrating my proficiency at editing plaintext files.

Good day!
