Hello, my name is Joel!

Three words to describe me are enthusiastic(!), bubbly, and spiritual!

I enjoy writing about myself, mountain climbing, and waiting on hold with the cable company for 54 minutes for something that could easily be done online! I traveled around the country to attend all 53 Phish concerts in 2018! It was a blast! I believe exclamation points are way overdone, but people get pretty weird when you just use a period! Oh well!
